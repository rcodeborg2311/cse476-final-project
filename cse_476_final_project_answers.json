In the short term, a reduction in the number of workers may lead to a decrease in output, as fewer labor inputs are available to produce goods or services. However, in the long term, if the reduction in labor is accompanied by increased capital investment (such as automation and mechanization), productivity per worker can rise significantly. This is because capital-intensive technologies can enhance the efficiency and output capacity of each remaining worker, potentially leading to higher overall productivity. Thus, while the immediate effect might be lower output, the long-term effect could be increased"

Thoreau argues that the majority's views, while sometimes correct, are not necessarily right, and individuals are free to dissent. Thus, the relationship is one of moral autonomy, where the individual is the final judge of right and wrong, and government is not an absolute authority."
